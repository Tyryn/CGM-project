# CGM-project
##Visualizing my your own Medtronic CGM data in an RShiny app.

The RShiny webapp allows a diabetic with a Medtronic continuous glucose monitor (CGM) 
to upload their raw data and analyse it. Medtronic's [Carelink](https://carelink.minimed.eu/) 
website allows users to download their recorded CGM data in csv format. This raw csv can
be then uploaded to this webapp. This web app offers a number of advantages over Carelink's
available reports.
